## Inspiration
As someone who's been through several technical interviews, I noticed a common challenge: the lack of real-time feedback and objective metrics during the interview process. This inspired me to create Synapse, a real-time conversational agent and analytics dashboard that transforms technical interviews into data-driven conversations. It also supports multiple languages to aid users in places where English is not the preferred medium.

## What I learned
Building Synapse pushed me to explore new technologies and concepts:

* Real-time WebSocket communication for instant data updates
* Speech analysis and natural language processing
* React state management for complex real-time visualizations
* Building intuitive dashboards that don't distract from the conversation

## How I built it
The project architecture consists of several key components:

* Frontend: React/Next with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern interface
* Backend: WebSocket server for real-time data transmission
* Speech Analysis: OpenAI API for conversations and voice processing
* Analytics: Custom algorithms for measuring technical terminology, confidence metrics, and engagement levels

## Challenges
Several interesting challenges emerged during development:

* Ensuring the dashboard enhanced rather than disrupted the interview flow
* Optimizing performance for real-time updates without browser lag
* Balancing between showing enough metrics while keeping the interface clean
* Creating algorithms that could accurately measure speaking patterns and engagement

## Accomplishments
What makes Synapse unique:

* Real-time visualization of interview metrics
* Non-intrusive design that complements the interview process
* Objective measurement of technical discussion quality
* Instant feedback for the candidate
* Multi-language support

## What's next
Future enhancements planned:

* Interview recording and playback features
* Customizable metrics for different types of technical interviews
* Integration with a Leetcode-style IDE window
